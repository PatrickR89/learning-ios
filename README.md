# learning-ios

Repository contains some of challenges and projects from "100 Days of Swift" course by Paul Hudson. They all contain differences from course's projects. This repository is a clone from my repository on Bitbucket where all of my projects are supervised by my mentor.

All of the projects avoid Storyboard, and their UI is defined only programmatically. Their structure is different from originals, as they were reconstructed accordingly to current iOS development standards. For learning those standards, I was given some examples and mostly articles from most popular iOS developers and websites which range from hackingwithswift.com, raywanderlich.com (which is now kodeco.com), articles from medium.com and many more.

With all projects I practiced creating proper commits, pull requests and merging.

Most notable projects: 

Challenge-d74 / Notes - where I first implemented MVVM pattern: https://github.com/PatrickR89/learning-ios/tree/main/challenge-d74-withMVVM/challenge-d74-withMVVM

challenge-d90 / Meme Editor - usage of Realm DB, app framework and extension: https://github.com/PatrickR89/learning-ios/tree/challenge-d90-withMVVM/challenge-d90-withMVVM/challenge-d90-withMVVM

challenge-d99 / Memory Game - usage of Combine, Realm, CryptoSwift, Coordinator pattern and more... :https://github.com/PatrickR89/learning-ios/tree/challenge-d99-memory-game/project-99

Last two branches are not merged to main, due to their merge delay on Bitbucket.

One more important note: For all projects in this repository SwiftLint is used for help to write cleaner and more readable code.
